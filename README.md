# Flappy-Dutch
Another Flappy Bird Clone

A Flappy Bird clone made from a friend's dare. The player is Robin van Persie, when he scored the flying header at the 2014 World Cup (Netherlands vs Spain).

The credits button doesn't do anything yet. Maybe an exit button.

Controls: mouse click for buttons, space bar to flap.
