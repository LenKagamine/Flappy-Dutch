# Flappy Dutch

A Flappy Bird clone made from a friend's dare. The player is Robin van Persie, when he scored the flying header at the 2014 World Cup (Netherlands vs Spain).

Controls: mouse click for buttons, space bar to flap/jump. Press D to show/hide his hitbox.

Note: due to Persie not being a rectangle, his hitbox is set around _his head and upper body_ (his legs ignore the pipes).
